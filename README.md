# House-prices-prediction
The goal of this project is to predict house prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, location, and other relevant factors. This is a classic regression problem in data science.

**Project Workflow:**

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding the dataset, identifying patterns, and visualizing relationships between variables.

**Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning the data, handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and encoding categorical variables.

**Feature Engineering:** Creating new features, transforming variables to improve model performance.

**Model Building:** Training and evaluating regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to predict house prices.

**Model Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and R-squared.

**Deployment and Reporting:** Saving the best-performing model, preparing reports and presentations summarizing findings, insights, and next steps.

**Additional Considerations & Version Control:** Using Git for version control to track changes, collaborate with team members, and maintain project history.

**Documentation:** Writing clear and concise documentation (in notebooks, README, and reports) to facilitate understanding and reproducibility.

This structure provides a comprehensive framework for organizing and presenting your Master's in Data Science project focused on predicting house prices. Adjust the specifics according to your dataset and project requirements.
